# DE-AFFIRMATION GENERATOR

## Description
Duration: evening project

I was thinking of small, easy things to build to help with my fundamentals. Affirmation generators are everywhere, so I put my own personal twist on them. Click the button to cycle through random Shutterstock images and random quotes.

## Technologies Used
- Javascript
- jQuery
- Nodejs
- PostgreSQL

## Installation
- Download or Clone repository
- Run 'npm install' from the command line
- Copy database.sql to your database, I recommend using Postico

## Future Plans
My only true future plans are to add more quotes and more photos.
