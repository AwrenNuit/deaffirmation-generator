# DE-AFFIRMATION GENERATOR

## Description
Duration: evening project

I was thinking of small, easy things to build to help with my fundamentals. Affirmation generators are everywhere, so I put my own personal twist on them. Click the button to cycle through random Shutterstock images and random quotes.

## Technologies Used
- Javascript
- jQuery
- Node.js
- PostgreSQL

## Future Plans
My only true future plans are to add more quotes and more photos.
